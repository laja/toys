Goal of this, first version:
  Collect all of the settings and notes I use. Compress and save them

I need the following modules:
  - a logger
  - a configuration reader, format is to be decided
  - something which checks the folders based on the configuration, and makes a list of all the existing files which should be saved
  - something which compresses these files into one

if this is done, additional stuff:
  - encrypt the compressed file
  - notify about success, failure, etc... (configureable) - dock notification, email, etc...
